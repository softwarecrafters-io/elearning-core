# Git Strategy

## Branches

- NEVER work directly on `master`
- ALWAYS create feature branch from `master`
- Naming: `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `refactor/short-description`

## Commits

### Conventional Commits format (concise)
- `feat: short description`
- `fix: short description`
- `refactor: short description`
- `test: short description`
- `docs: short description`
- `chore: short description`

### Special TDD commit
- `green: descriptive test name`
- Commit every time a test turns green

### Rules
- Commit with EVERY green test
- Concise messages (max 50 characters ideally)
- ALWAYS write commit messages in English
- NEVER use --no-verify to skip hooks

## Hooks (NEVER skip)

### Pre-commit (already configured)
- lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier)
- npm run compile (TypeScript)

### Pre-push (already configured)
- npm run validate (compile + all tests)

## Pull Requests

### Create PR
```bash
gh pr create --base master --title "feat: description" --body "Detailed description" --reviewer softwarecrafters-io
```

**Important**: ALWAYS add `--reviewer softwarecrafters-io` to notify the Tech Lead via email.

### Read Tech Lead feedback
```bash
# View general comments
gh pr view <number> --comments

# View inline code comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments
```

### Workflow

1. Create feature branch from master
2. Develop with TDD (commit on each green)
3. Push (validated by hooks)
4. Create PR with gh
5. Wait for Tech Lead feedback
6. When told "review-pr", read comments with gh
7. Apply changes and push
8. Tech Lead approves and merges

## Commands

### `pr-review`

When the Tech Lead writes `pr-review`, I must:

1. **Read PR feedback**:
   - Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - Find open PR: `gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,url`
   - Read general comments: `gh pr view <number> --comments`
   - Read inline code comments: `gh api repos/softwarecrafters-io/elearning-core/pulls/<number>/comments`

2. **Review architecture rules** before making changes:
   - @.cursor/rules/architecture-domain-value-objects.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/architecture-domain-entities.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/architecture-domain-repositories.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/architecture-application-usecases.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/architecture-application-dtos.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/design-naming.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/design-functions.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/design-classes-modules.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/design-errors.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/practices-testing.mdc
   - @.cursor/rules/practices-tdd.mdc

3. **Summarize feedback** received from Tech Lead

4. **Apply changes** following:
   - Architecture rules from step 2
   - Tech Lead comments from step 1
   - TDD practices (if changes require new tests)

5. **Commit and push** the fixes with appropriate commit message

If the Tech Lead specifies a PR number (`pr-review #123`), use that number directly.

### `pr-review` with context

If Tech Lead mentions a specific file, line, or concern alongside `pr-review`, focus on that area first while still reviewing all comments.
