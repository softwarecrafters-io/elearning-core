# Git Strategy

## Branches

- NEVER work directly on `master`
- ALWAYS create feature branch from `master`
- Naming: `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `refactor/short-description`

## Commits

### Conventional Commits format (concise)
- `feat: short description`
- `fix: short description`
- `refactor: short description`
- `test: short description`
- `docs: short description`
- `chore: short description`

### Special TDD commit
- `green: descriptive test name`
- Commit every time a test turns green

### Rules
- Commit with EVERY green test
- Concise messages (max 50 characters ideally)
- ALWAYS write commit messages in English
- NEVER use --no-verify to skip hooks

## Hooks (NEVER skip)

### Pre-commit (already configured)
- lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier)
- npm run compile (TypeScript)

### Pre-push (already configured)
- npm run validate (compile + all tests)

## Pull Requests

### Create PR
```bash
gh pr create --base master --title "feat: description" --body "Detailed description" --reviewer softwarecrafters-io
```

**Important**: ALWAYS add `--reviewer softwarecrafters-io` to notify the Tech Lead via email.

### Read Tech Lead feedback
```bash
# View general comments
gh pr view <number> --comments

# View inline code comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments
```

### Workflow

1. Create feature branch from master
2. Develop with TDD (commit on each green)
3. Push (validated by hooks)
4. Create PR with `pr-create` command
5. Wait for Tech Lead feedback
6. When told `pr-review`, read comments and apply changes
7. Tech Lead approves and merges

## Commands

See `.cursor/commands/` for available commands:
- `pr-create` - Push and create PR with reviewer
- `pr-review` - Read feedback and apply changes
