Stop and be critical. Before continuing, question yourself about this code or decision:

**Design & Architecture:**
- Is this the simplest solution? Can it be simpler?
- Does this violate any SOLID principle?
- Is there a code smell here?

**Naming & Clarity:**
- Do names clearly express intention?
- Would another developer understand this immediately?

**Necessity:**
- Do we really need this now? (YAGNI)
- Is this solving a real problem or a hypothetical one?

**Alternatives:**
- What other approaches exist?
- What are the trade-offs of each option?

Do NOT implement anything. Only analyze and share your critical assessment.
